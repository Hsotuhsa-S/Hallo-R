This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}

vector1 = c(32, 'hi', 'TRUR', 'imbi', 111)
vector1[2] = "mdsc"
length(vector1)

vector2 = rep(11:13, 3)
vector3 = seq (0, 1, 0.2)
length(vector2)
length(vector3)

matrix1 = matrix(c(1:12), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE )
matrix2 = matrix(vector1)
length(matrix1)
length(matrix2)



```
Test funtions.

```{r}

vectorSum(vector2)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
